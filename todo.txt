Fix positioning
Fix size
Show something on hover (value of arbitrage)
Only write first several characters of exchange (rest maybe on hover)
Slider to change date (and therefore the data set used)
Create data sets in python using csv files? Or JSON might be easier. JSON accessing sounds easier and doesn't require much memory probably.
Fix negative values scaling (domain?)
merge into rest of their shit
Show best arbitrage rate by enlarging that cell
Have N/A (grey?) cell for buying/selling to same exchange as default
